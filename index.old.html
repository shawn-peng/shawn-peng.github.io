	<p>Yisu Peng, Yuxiang Jiang, Predrag Radivojac</p>

	<p>Yisu Peng has solved the problem of exact enumeration of all sub-graphs 
of a given directed acyclic graph (DAG). This is a non-trivial 
enumeration problem that has been solved for trees by Fred Ruskey in 
1981 (Ruskey F. Listing and counting subtrees of a tree. SIAM J. Comput. 
10, 141-151, 1981). Ruskey's work has been later extended to weighted 
trees but to our knowledge the solution for DAGs had not been proposed 
before our paper. Yisu proposed a recursive partitioning approach and 
together with another student on that project, Yuxiang Jiang, proved its 
correctness. He implemented the algorithm in C and evaluated it on 
multiple synthetic DAGs. Then he proposed several practical speed-ups 
that were necessary to apply this algorithm to large biomedical 
ontologies such as Gene Ontology that have over 30,000 nodes. The paper 
itself has another data analysis/bioinformatics component that was 
jointly handled by Yisu and Yuxiang Jiang. In terms of writing, Yisu 
contributed to the first draft of the paper. Besides the intrinsic 
appeal of solving a computer science problem, the instrumental 
importance of this paper was in characterizing the cardinality of the 
structured output space in protein function prediction and providing 
another perspective on why this prediction problem is so difficult. 
Yisu's work is going to gain traction and might be one of the 
contributing factors of reducing the sizes of the ontologies if the 
community is going to make further advances in this direction, which 
itself has a significant biomedical importance.
